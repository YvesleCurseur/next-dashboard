### Setup Font is the best thing to use: 

https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images

Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the next/font module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.
